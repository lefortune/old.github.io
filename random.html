    <h1>Random Things</h1>
    <p>The reason for this part of the site is probably from sheer boredom.</p>
    <h3>Thoughts</h3>
    <p>Some of these you might have an answer to, but don't, my own dignity prohibits that.
    <ul>
      <li>How come black markers are slightly green? I feel scammed by Croyala :(
      <li>Why aren't blueberries blue? Out of all, it should be called INDIGOBERRIES.
      <li>How did the first smoking addict discover how to smoke? Were they, like, breathing tobacco as they burnt it? Whaat?
      </li>
